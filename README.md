# ionic-rails

ionic-rails wraps the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) library for use in Rails 3.1 and above. Assets will minify automatically during production.

## Usage

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'ionic-rails'

Add the directives to your JavaScript and Stylesheet manifest files:

    //= require ionic

## Versioning

Every attempt is made to mirror the currently shipping Ionic version number wherever possible.

The major, minor, and patch version numbers will always represent the Ionic version.
